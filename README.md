### Bikeshare project file for Udacity
This script asks the user if they would like to explore US bikeshare data.
User is given an option to explore data for multiple cities, currently including
Chicago, New York City, and Washington. User has the option to look at data for
any or all available months and days. Statistics are provided based on
filter criteria.

### Custom Data Display Function
This code includes a custom function "data_display", written from scratch. This
function prompts the user if they want to see 5 lines of raw data, displays the
data if answer is 'yes', iterates the prompts and displays another 5 lines if
the user chooses. The program stops at the end of the file or if the user
responds 'no'.
